# Notes on Express Workflow

MVC method
- models, views, controllers
- views aren't needed this project due to client-server architecture w/ client provided
- controllers are stored with routes for easier access

Models:
- We hold our data in the models

Controller: 
- We hold all our functions for retrieving data in controller

Routes:
- We combine model and routes to be exported to the app.js
